This file details how your server "talks" to the rest of the network.

What it does: It configures the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

Technical Detail: You mapped the notConfigUser to the public community string.

The Logic: In professional networking, a "Community String" acts as a shared secret. By setting this to public, you enabled Jaye's monitoring station to "poll" (ask for) your CPU and RAM statistics without needing a complex login every few seconds.
